Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have been able to create the AI paddle that is reasonably beatable for one player to play against. There was available source code in the "Pong" track where I was 
able to successfully run the game in the LOVE application. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Have not yet implemented color changes according to score, and have not yet created a menu for the player to choose whether they want to play against AI or against another person.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

There was initially an issue of how to make an AI paddle stay relative to the ball but in a way that was fair and beatable for the player. However, adding a degree of "random"
allowed to solve this issue, but the paddle still has a tendency to "shake" up and down when trying to be in relation to the ball.
