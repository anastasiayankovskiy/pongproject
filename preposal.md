# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I was considering making a pong game with more visual elements, such as color changes whenever the ball hits a paddle and such. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I'll be doing this project individually. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I cannot think of any specific ones yet.
