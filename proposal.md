# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Color Pong 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A pong game that changes color based on score.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

There will be an option to play against the AI, or against another person if the players can share the keyboard used to play the game. Similar to the explanation provided for 
the "Pong" track in Canvas, my software will have an AI-controlled paddle, as well as an alternative option for a second player paddle, to deflect the ball. The paddles will be controlled with keyboard buttons, one with arrow keys and the other (player 2) with "WASD" inputs. It will use the LOVE framework & Lua programming language. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A pong game that changes color based on score. For example, the background will be a shade of red if the score is at match point (for example, 9-3, & the game is to 10 points).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game has both an option for the opposing paddle to be AI-controlled OR player-controlled by a second player.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A pong game that changes color based on score, with both paddles implemented for an AI option and a player 2 option. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

One skill will be to figure out how to ensure the paddle moves in relation to the ball for the AI-controlled paddle.
